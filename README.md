## some changes I made

- /nvim/lua/mynvim/core/keymaps.lua
  I add some functions to justy your file type that you are writing, so you can use <leader> + r to fast compile and run a cpp/python/c/java demo.

- nvim/lua/mynvim/core/options.lua
  When you create a new file, it will automatically add a header in your file, and you can change as you see fit.
  And the cursor will remember where it is when you close a file.

- add a new plugin
  lukas-reineke/indent-blankline.nvim

- change lua server from sumneko_lua to lua_ls

- make some change to install more fast
